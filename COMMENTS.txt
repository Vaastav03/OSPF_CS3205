Experience:
    Compared to GBN the threading here was compact and clear and which made the task indeed trivial
    computing dijkstras and waiting for long for the output has been the tedious part of the assignment.
    Else everything was pretty decent and fine as the formats were very clear parsing and intialising the 
    values has become simpler to avoid the ambiguities.

Suggestions for change:
    Optimizing OSPF settings: There are a number of settings that can be adjusted within OSPF to improve its performance. For example, 
    adjusting the hello and dead timers can help to reduce the amount of network traffic generated by OSPF. 
    Similarly, adjusting the SPF delay or changing the metric calculation can help to improve the overall performance of OSPF.

    Implementing authentication: OSPF supports authentication, which can be used to ensure that only authorized routers are able to participate in the network. 
    Implementing authentication can help to improve network security and prevent unauthorized access to OSPF networks.

Feedback:
    The question had an ambiguity intially it was only asked to find the routing table of the given identifier but later in what to submit section it
    was mentioned to submit all output files for all routers with their routing table information.
    The timing of the assignment was underwhelming because the syllabus related to ospf just got covered 1 week before the deadline and 
    with nearing endsems it wasnt a steady flow of having an assignment deadline even on the very last working day.
